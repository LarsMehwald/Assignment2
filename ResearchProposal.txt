Introduction
Most of crime studies are based on the rational choice assumptions of legal and criminal returns and the importnace of deterrence to reduce criminal behaviours (G. Backer, 2002). Nevertheless, less has been written about the relevance of social interactions explaining criminal behaviours. Some literature, though, has focused on the relaiton between violent crimes and social capital. Lederman et al. (2002) identified that the prevalence of trust on community members has an effect on violent crimes and that the social cohesion through participation and membership in community oranisations only impact violent crime levels depending on the typ of religious and social organisation. Additionally, Hanslaimer (2014) showed that atruism has a general negative effect on violent crimes, but other indicators of social capital only proved to be related to other types of high impact crime and not to violent crime.
Social capital theory... particulary in Germany...
With new data available for crime statistics for the years 2013 and 2014 at the districts' level in Germany it is relavant to study the incidence of high impact crimes and its relation to social capital formation. 
Results might be meaningful as rational for public intervention using crime reduction strategies that help build up social capital at the community level (e.g. funding of sport clubs, gathering community, subsidies for staying in a community), instead of more aggresive interventionist policing strategies. Strategies that are less police intensive might have higher public support and might be seen as more legitimate, rather than pure policing strategies. Social engagement at the local level might also help increase trust levels across community memebers and encorage more altruistic behaviours among them. 
Cost-efficient: social capital vs policing 

Social Capital indicators: 
- Networks and Links: social bonds, meeting points, coolaboration -> marriage
- Shared norms, values, understanding 
- Groups participation/ commitment 

Dimensions of scoial capital: 
â€¢ civic participation
â€¢ social networks and support
â€¢ social participation
â€¢ reciprocity and trust
â€¢ views about the area


It is relevant for
- Why is this important? 
- New data
- Argument (policy implication) for state intervention to build up social capital 

Literature Review
- crime theory (Daniel check out what fits)
    disorganization theory: groups organization and interaction affect predaatory crime levels.
    anomie theory: environments where people lack a stron moral order and behave egositically, dimishing social trust.
    deprivation/strain theory: resource scarcity that prevent society members from achieving their common goals. 
- social capital theory (text in Springer book)

Research Question
- How does social capital (in social networks and social bonds) in a community determine the level of (violent) crime? 
- maybe we focus on type of crime that is more harmful for the community (e.g. Sachbeschädigung, Gewalttaten) 

Hypotheses
- Operalization:the more social capital (better networks and closer social ties/structures), the less (violent) crime observed. 

Methodology 
In order to answer the research question, we - Operationalize social capital
- OLS regression
- maybe panel (t=2)

Data
Our dependent variable crime rate can be obtained from the German Federal Police's crime statistic ("Polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik" PKS) for the years 2013 and 2014 on a district level ("Kreis"). This data is also disaggregated regarding the type of crime. This number however is missing the dark figure of crime - the unreportet number of crime in this area. Different methods exist to assess the dark figure of crime, but it is difficult to assess their reliability. Depending on the type of crime, the reported numbers might contain a structural bias, i.e. some types of crime are reported at a different rate than others (e.g. when insurance companies require individual reporting). Since we focus on crimes that disrupt the social community, we expect a high level of reporting and this reporting to be consistenly high across different types of disruptive crimes. It is possible to focus on one type of crime, but also to construct a dependent variable summarising different types of crime. The latter approach might prove util, since this provides greater variance in the dependent variable. 
We want to measure different dimensions of our independent variable social capital. We beginn with a measurement for the networks and links dimension. This dimension highlights the importance of social bonds and meeting points in a community. We attempt to operationalise this dimension with indicators of marriages and migration. The indicator marriaged couples as a percentage of the population captures the notion that enhanced social ties increase the social capital of a community. Nevertheless this measure might be unreliable, since other forms of cohabitation (that are not measured by official statistics) can generate enhanced social links. The other indicator, migration, aims at capturing the fluctuation of a region with other regions in Germany or with other nations. Since social capital requires time to build up, we expect higher crime rates in areas with high fluctuations.
Moreover we need distric level data for other variables to control for local heterogeneity. This data is provided by the German statistical bureau. We want to control for factors that influence the rational choice for committing a crime. First, unemployment changes the opportunity costs of punishment, i.e. imprisonment. Second, the level of income: high income reduces the punishment felt by individuals for minor charges (monetary penalty), but has no predetermined impact on the impact of inprisonment. In addition we want to control for a district's composition in age, gender and population density. As for now, we expect to obtain measures for some variables only for 2013. It needs to be determined, whether the fluctuation of the variable before 2013 allows to assume indentical values for 2014.
