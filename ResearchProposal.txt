Introduction
- Why is this important? 
- New data
- Argument (policy implication) for state intervention to build up social capital (e.g. funding sports, gathering community, ...) 

Literature Review
- crime theory (Daniel check out what fits)
- social capital theory (text in Springer book)

Research Question
- How does social capital in a community determine the level of crime? 
- maybe we focus on type of crime that is more harmful for the community (e.g. SachbeschÃ¤digung, Gewalttaten) 

Hypotheses
- the more social capital, the less crime observed 

Methodology 
- Operationalize social capital
- OLS regression
- maybe panel (t=2)

Data
- PKS 2013-2014 Kreis-data
- reported crime -> bias in data (missing: dark figure of crime) 
- regionalstatistik.de -> difficult to get 2013/2014 data
- discuss time inconsistency -> assumption about constant data 

Analysis
- statistical adjustments for inefficient, biased estimators?

Conclusion
